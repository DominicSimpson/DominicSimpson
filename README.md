### ðŸŒ± That's me in the image above. I have am currently a Tech Trainee at [La Fosse Associaties](https://www.lafosse.com/). Prior to this, I completed a [Data Analyst Experience Accelerator Fellowship](https://io-sphere.io/data-analytics), run by the company iO-Sphere, having previously graduated from a [Skills Bootcamp in Data Analytics](https://info.cambridgespark.com/dfe-skills-bootcamp-in-data-analytics) at the Government-funded educational provider Cambridge Spark. You can view details about my work at iO-Sphere [here](https://dominic-simpson.co.uk/portfolio/iosphere-data-analyst-experience-accelerator); meanwhile, my personal portfolio project for the Bootcamp at Cambridge Spark, based on UN Population Data statistics, can be viewed [here](https://dominic-simpson.co.uk/portfolio/un-population-dataset-project).

### Before the above, I also graduated from learning Software Development <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WUlplcMpOCEmTGBtBW/giphy.gif" width="30"> at [Founders & Coders](http://www.foundersandcoders.com), based in [Space4](https://space4.tech), Finsbury Park, London, UK, a hub for [Tech for Better](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/tech-for-better). Other organisations based at the hub include [Outlandish](http://www.outlandish.com), who create tech for positive social impacts; and [Breakthrough](https://www.wearebreakthrough.org), who have pioneered teaching tech and business to recent prison leavers.

I graduated from Founders & Coders' full-time [Software Development Bootcamp](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/apprenticeship) as a member of cohort [FAC26](https://github.com/fac26) in April 2023, while working part-time in Customer Service at the [Barbican Centre](http://www.barbican.org.uk); you can [read a portfolio assessment of my work on the Bootcamp projects](https://github.com/DominicSimpson/portfolio).

After graduating from Founders & Coders, I mentored students on the FAC27 cohort, before landing a Software Development internship at [Octophin Digital](https://octophindigital.com), which pioneers tech for the wildlife conservation, charity, and arts sectors. My work at Octophin is [detailed in this portfolio entry](https://dominic-simpson.co.uk/portfolio/octophin-digital-global-safety-net-others). My interest in the data side of things during my internship at Octophin led me to undertake the Bootcamp at Cambridge Spark, followed by a place on iO-Sphere's Data Analyst Experience Accelerator Fellowship, which I completed in December 2024.

### :telescope: A portfolio of my work can be viewed here on my GitHub profile. In addition, you can also view [my LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominicbernardsimpson).

My background prior to learning coding and working in Customer Experience was as an Editorial Assistant at [Wilmington PLC](http://www.wilmingtonplc.com), a large publishing house (including B2B) in North London. I worked on directories of charities, pensions, finance, and global politics, including project managing the Online Donations and Goodwill Gallery services, in which members of the public could donate money and goods respectively to charities. My role there included some HTML via Dreamweaver, while working on the company website, and extensive research on global statistics while compiling some of the directories. 

After leaving Wilmington PLC, I completed a Post-Graduate Diploma in Journalism, wrote freelance for the [Hackney Citizen](http://www.hackneycitizen.co.uk), and volunteered as a Team Leader at the Southbank Centre (including helping build the [Festival Village](https://festivalvillage.wordpress.com) arts space). I also completed some work at _The Observer_ newspaper and [7digital.com](http://www.7digital.com), a music and brands platform. For the latter, I also used HTML on the company website while there.

- I identify as autistic and have ADHD

- ðŸŒ† Ask me about capital cities in countries - I have an encyclopaedic knowledge

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him

- ðŸ™Œ I volunteer in my spare time as Secretary for the not-for-profit organisation [Sustainable Hackney](http://www.sustainablehackney.org.uk), devoted to local sustainable projects; we have recently been scrutinizing Hackney Council's draft Climate Action Plan. I also agitate for electoral reform in the UK as part of [Make Votes Matter](http://www.makevotesmatter.org.uk). In addition, I recently managed to convince my local MP, Diane Abbott, to put her support behind [Power for People](http://www.powerforpeople.org.uk)'s local energy scheme, via attending a meeting with her in Parliament, accompanied by two members of staff from Power for People. The [local electricity bill](https://powerforpeople.org.uk/the-local-electricity-bill) is currently making its way through Parliament.

- ðŸ™Œ From 2014-2017, I volunteered for the Arts Council-funded project [A Hackney Autobiography](http://www.ahackneyautobiography.org.uk), based at [Bishopsgate Institute](https://www.bishopsgate.org.uk) in east London. The project looked into the history of Centerprise, a community centre that existed in Hackney from 1971-2012. Centerprise was a local publishing project, bookshop, cafe, arts space, housing advice section, and hub for many local activist groups, who used its spare rooms. The project looked at the history of Hackney particularly during the 70s and 80s, with Centerprise at its centre, and led to a book, app, and website. Centerprise's vast plethora of literature and ephemera has been transferred to Bishopsgate's legendary archives, which is why the project was located there.

- ðŸ¥¶ Fun fact: I've been to the most Northern-located town in the world - [Longyearbyen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longyearbyen) in Svalbard, an archipelago owned by Norway, with only the Arctic and North Pole beyond. While there, I also checked out a still-active Russian mining town (leased to Russia from Norway) called Barentsburg, where I drank vodka in the Northern-most distillery in the world. Accordingly, I now hope to visit one day [Ushuaia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ushuaia), the southern-most city in the world, in Patagonia, Argentina (and hopefully drink vodka there too).
