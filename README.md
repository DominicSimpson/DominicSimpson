### üå± That's me in the image above. I‚Äôm currently learning Software Development <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WUlplcMpOCEmTGBtBW/giphy.gif" width="30"> at [Founders & Coders](http://www.foundersandcoders.com), based in [Space4](https://space4.tech), Finsbury Park, London, a hub for [Tech for Better](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/tech-for-better). Other organisations based at the hub include [Outlandish](http://www.outlandish.com).

I am currently undertaking Founders & Coder's full-time Software Development Apprenticeship as a member of cohort FAC26, while working part-time in Customer Service at the [Barbican Centre](http://www.barbican.org.uk), having previously completed the required [Skills Bootcamp](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/skills-bootcamp), for which you can [read a portfolio assessment of my work on the Bootcamp projects](https://github.com/DominicSimpson/portfolio). In the meantime, [here is a synopsis of what I am learning on the Apprenticeship](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/apprenticeship).

My background prior to learning in coding and Customer Experience was as an Editorial Assistant at [Wilmington PLC](http://www.wilmingtonplc.com), a large publishing house (including B2B) in North London. I worked on directories of charities, pensions, finance, and global politics, including project managing the Online Donations and Goodwill Gallery services, in which members of the public could donate money and goods respectively to charities. My role there included some HTML via Dreamweaver, while working on the company website, and extensive research on global statistics when compiling some of the directories. 

After leaving Wilmington PLC, I completed a Post-Graduate Diploma in Journalism, wrote freelance for the [Hackney Citizen](http://www.hackneycitizen.co.uk), and volunteered as a Team Leader at the Southbank Centre (including helping build the [Festival Village](https://festivalvillage.wordpress.com) arts space). I also did some work at _The Observer_ newspaper and [7digital.com](http://www.7digital.com), a music and brands platform. For the latter, I also used HTML on the company website while there.

- üôå I volunteer in my spare time as Secretary for the not-for-profit organisation [Sustainable Hackney](http://www.sustainablehackney.org.uk), devoted to local sustainable projects, and I also agitate for electoral reform in the UK as part of [Make Votes Matter](http://www.makevotesmatter.org.uk). In addition, I recently managed to convince my local MP, Diane Abbott, to put her support behind [Power for People](http://www.powerforpeople.org.uk)'s local energy scheme via attending a meeting with her in Parliament, accompanied by two members of staff from Power for People. The [local electricity bill](https://powerforpeople.org.uk/the-local-electricity-bill) is currently making its way through Parliament.

- üôå From 2014-2017, I volunteered for the Arts Council-funded project [A Hackney Autobiography](http://www.ahackneyautobiography.org.uk), based at [Bishopsgate Institute](https://www.bishopsgate.org.uk) in east London. The project looked into the history of Centerprise, a community centre that existed in Hackney from 1971-2012. Centerprise was a local publishing project, bookshop, cafe, arts space, housing advice section, and hub for many local activist groups, who used its spare rooms. The project looked at the history of Hackney particularly during the 70s and 80s, with Centerprise at its centre, and led to a book, app, and website. Centerprise's vast plethora of literature and ephemera has been transferred to [Bishopsgate Institute](https://www.bishopsgate.org.uk)'s legendary archives, which is why the project was located there.

- ü•∂ Fun fact: I've been to the most Northern-located town in the world - [Longyearbyen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longyearbyen) in Svalbard, an archipelago owned by Norway, with only the Arctic and North Pole beyond. While there, I also checked out a still-active Russian mining town (leased to Russia from Norway) called Barentsburg, where I drank vodka in the Northern-most distillery in the world. Accordingly, I now hope to visit one day [Ushuaia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ushuaia), the southern-most city in the world, in Patagonia, Argentina (and hopefully drink vodka there too).
