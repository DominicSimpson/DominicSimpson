# Hi there, I'm Dominic ðŸ‘‹


**DominicSimpson/DominicSimpson** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Software Development at [Founders & Coders](http://www.foundersandcoders.com) in [Space4](https://space4.tech), Finsbury Park, London, as part of cohort FAC26, while working part-time in Customer Service at the [Barbican Centre](http://www.barbican.org.uk). If successful, I hope to go on to complete a Software Apprenticeship. I am learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, including fetch and promises, as well as Git workflow. [This is a more detailed synopsis of what I am learning on the Bootcamp](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/skills-bootcamp/).
### A portfolio of my work can be viewed on [my website](http://www.dominicsimpson.co.uk), in the 'Animation' and 'Web Development' sections. In addition, you can also view [my LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominicbernardsimpson).
My background prior to learning in coding and Customer Experience was as an Editorial Assistant at [Wilmington PLC](http://www.wilmingtonplc.com), a large publishing house (including B2B) in North London. I also completed a Post-Graduate Diploma in Journalism.
- ðŸŒ† Ask me about capital cities in countries - I have an encyclopaedic knowledge.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- ðŸ™Œ I volunteer in my spare time as Secretary for the not-for-profit organisation [Sustainable Hackney](http://www.sustainablehackney.org.uk). From 2014-2017, I volunteered for the Arts Council-funded project [A Hackney Autobiography](http://www.ahackneyautobiography.org.uk), based at Bishopsgate Institute in east London.
- ðŸš€ Fun fact: I've been to the most Northern town in the world - Longyearbyen in Svalbard, an archipelago owned by Norway. While there, I also checked out a still-active Russian mining town (leased to Russia from Norway) called Barentsburg, where I drank vodka in the Northern-most distillery in the world. Accordingly, I now hope to visit one day [Ushuaia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ushuaia), the southern-most city in the world, in Patagonia, Argentina.
