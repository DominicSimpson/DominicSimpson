# Hi there, I'm Dominic ðŸ‘‹


**DominicSimpson/DominicSimpson** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Software Development at [Founders & Coders](http://www.foundersandcoders.com) in Finsbury Park, as part of cohort FAC26, while working part-time in Customer Service at the Barbican Centre. If successful, I hope to go on to complete a Software Apprenticeship. You can see what we are learning on the Bootcamp [here](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/skills-bootcamp/).
My background prior to learning in coding and Customer Experience was as an Editorial Assistant at Wilmington PLC, a large publishing house (including B2B) in North London.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about capital cities in countries - I have an encyclopaedic knowledge.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've been to the most Northern town in the world - Longyearbyen in Svalbard. While I was there, I drank vodka in the Northern-most vodka distillery in the world. Accordingly, I now hope to visit one day Ushuaia, the southern-most city in the world, in Patagonia, Argentina.
