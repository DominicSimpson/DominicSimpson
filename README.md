### üå± That's me in the image above. I‚Äôm currently learning Software Development <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WUlplcMpOCEmTGBtBW/giphy.gif" width="30"> at [Founders & Coders](http://www.foundersandcoders.com) in [Space4](https://space4.tech), Finsbury Park, London, as part of cohort FAC26, while working part-time in Customer Service at the [Barbican Centre](http://www.barbican.org.uk). If successful, I hope to go on to complete a Software Apprenticeship. I am learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, including fetch and promises, as well as Git workflow. [This is a more detailed synopsis of what I am learning on the Bootcamp](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/skills-bootcamp/).

### :fire: My Stats : https://github-readme-streak-stats.herokuapp.com/?user=dominic_simpson

My background prior to learning in coding and Customer Experience was as an Editorial Assistant at [Wilmington PLC](http://www.wilmingtonplc.com), a large publishing house (including B2B) in North London. I also completed a Post-Graduate Diploma in Journalism, and wrote freelance for the [Hackney Citizen](http://www.hackneycitizen.co.uk).
- üåÜ Ask me about capital cities in countries - I have an encyclopaedic knowledge.
- üòÑ Pronouns: he/him
- ‚úàÔ∏è [Here's some nice photos from my travels and at home in London](https://dominicsimpson.co.uk/photography.html)
- üôå I volunteer in my spare time as Secretary for the not-for-profit organisation [Sustainable Hackney](http://www.sustainablehackney.org.uk), devoted to local sustainable projects. From 2014-2017, I volunteered for the Arts Council-funded project [A Hackney Autobiography](http://www.ahackneyautobiography.org.uk), based at Bishopsgate Institute in east London.
- ü•∂ Fun fact: I've been to the most Northern-located town in the world - [Longyearbyen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longyearbyen) in Svalbard, an archipelago owned by Norway, with only the Arctic and North Pole beyond. While there, I also checked out a still-active Russian mining town (leased to Russia from Norway) called Barentsburg, where I drank vodka in the Northern-most distillery in the world. Accordingly, I now hope to visit one day [Ushuaia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ushuaia), the southern-most city in the world, in Patagonia, Argentina.
